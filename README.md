# PizzaFactory


excercises on the MultiThreading which consists of adding pizza in a stock and at the same time make delivery in stores. 
I use here syncronization for the course of the operations. 
At the same time as an option there is a log which is create at each launch of the application,
to save the operation in a text file.
